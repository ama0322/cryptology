Needed Modules:



USAGE OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
    User input is unix-like, with: command [optional flag] (argument) <optional argument>
    File paths with spaces must escape spaces with : "\ "
    The working directory is the outer Cryptography file. For example, the file path of Clarissa.txt in Resources is
        Resources/Library/Clarissa.txt

    encrypt (cipher) (plaintext_file_path*)  <output_file_path>
        This encrypts with "cipher" using the text from "plaintext_file_path" as a plaintext. There will be two files
        created as a result of this encryption: the encrypted file AND info about the encryption. "output_file_path",
        if provided, is the location where the encrypted file is created. Otherwise, a default file path will be
        created. The info about the encryption is stored in a file with the same name as the "output_file_path" but
        appended with "_(Relevant information)".

        *the "plaintext_file_path" may be shortened to just the file name and not the whole file path. For example,
        Resources/Library/Clarissa.txt can be passed in as Clarissa.txt and the command will still work. This will only
        work for the files in The four folders in the Resources folder.

    decrypt (cipher) (ciphertext_file_path) <output_file_path>
        Does the same thing as encrypt, but decrypts. Note that there are more decryption ciphers than encryption ones.
        This is because some decryption ciphers only decrypt.

    test    OR    test [optional flag]    OR    test (decryption_cipher)
        1. test
            Just typing "test" will enter into testing mode, where the word "test" is already provided as the first
            command and [optional flag] or (decryption_cipher) must be inputted

        2. test [optional flag]
            Flags:
                -e: exit the testing mode back into regular mode where commands other than "test" can be used
                -a: automated testing. Tests are run automatically on all decryption ciphers. If this flag is provided
                    while NOT already in testing mode, then the user is automatically exited out of testing mode upon
                    completion. Otherwise, if ALREADY IN testing mode, then program will continue in testing mode.
                -c: will clear all logs in Resources/Files_Logs

        3. test (decryption_cipher)
            This command will run a test with parameters (such as plaintext, key...) described in Cryptography/test.py.
            The corresponding encrypt cipher to the user provided "decryption_cipher" will be used to encrypt the
            plaintext. Then, the ciphertext will be decrypted with the user provided "decryption_cipher". This
            decryption result will be compared against the plaintext for correctness.

    database [optional flags] (cipher) (new_database_file_name)    OR     database (database_file_name)
             OR     database [optional flags]
        1. database [optional flags] (cipher) (new_database_file_name)
            Flags:
                -n (cipher) (new_database_file_name): Create a new database with name: "new_database_file_name". The
                method of encryption is "cipher", which must be a valid encryption cipher. The program will ask for the
                key for encryption and/or decryption later on if necessary.


        2. database (database_file_name)
            Open up the encrypted database named: "database_file_name"

        3. database [optional flags]
            Flags:
                -c: Clear all files in the Resources/Database folder. The program will ask the user for a check before
                the deletion actually occurs.

    help
        Will print out helpful information

    exit
        Will exit the program

    clear
        Clears files in Files_Decrypted and Files_Encrypted

PROJECT STRUCTURE (Cryptography)
    This project has four main components, as well as four folders for storage.

        The six main components (in Cryptography) are:
            -cryptography_runner.py - this file holds the main runner program that takes in user input, and performs the
                      encryption/decryption.
            -misc.py - this file holds functions and resources useful throughout the project.
            -test.py - this file runs the decryption/encryption functions and tests for correctness and performance
            -database.py - this file holds everything necessary for handling the encryption/decryption of databases.
            -package Decryption - this package holds all files necessary to perform a decryption
            -package Encryption - this package holds all files necessary to perform an encryption


        The five folders are:
            -Resources/Library - this folder stores all text files you want to use with this program
            -Resources/Files_Decrypted - this is where the generated decrypted files go
            -Resources/Files_Encrypted - this is where the generated encrypted files go
            -Resources/Files_Logs - where the logs from testing go
            -Resources/Databases - holds encrypted databases, along with info files about those databases.







CRYPTOGRAPHY_RUNNER.PY



MISC.PY
    This file holds functions and resources useful throughout the project

    Structure:
        I. Resources - this area hold resources that generally deal with the type of encryptions/decryptions and
        character sets available. Also, some resources necessary for algorithms in the same file is also stored here.

        II. User Interfacing and Function Calls - these functions are called from files from Decryption and Encryption
        when their execute() function is called. It makes calls to Section IV in order to get
        user data and write down useful information. These functions also return the encrypted/decrypted text back to
        execute()

        III. Useful Algorithms - this contains algorithms that are used in encrypt() and decrypt() from files in
        Encryption and Decryption

        IV. Helper Functions - functions to process user input and write down relevant information. Called from
        functions in Section II for convenience.


TEST.PY


ENCRYPTION

    GENERAL FILE FORMAT
        def execute() - this function makes a call to misc's function to encrypt/decrypt in the section:
        USER INTERFACING AND FUNCTION CALLS. misc's function asks for user input and and writes down
        relevant information to a file. It also returns the encrypted text for this function(execute) to return
        back to cryptography_runner.py. This function is called from cryptography_runner.py

        def encrypt() - this function contains the actual algorithm to encrypt the plaintext. It is generally called
        from misc' encrypt/decrypt function. When in testing mode, however, it is called from test.py

    ROTATION.PY
        This shifts the unicode values of the plaintext up (addition) by the amount that the key is in unicode.


    RSA.PY
        This encrypts using an RSA cipher with no padding. If the text is longer than the key, then the text
            is divided into blocks that are the same size as the key. The public key and the private key format is this:
            "RSA (length of e or d) (e or d) n" These strings are rendered in a encoded form using whichever scheme.

         Note: The public key in base4096 encoding is a bit difficult to enter in correctly.


    VIGENERE.PY
        This is the regular vigenere that does what is expected. Straighforward.


    VIGENERE_EXPONENTIAL.PY
        This vigenere takes the plaintext value to the power of the keyword character value. This
            results in a ciphertext whose characters are even more evenly distributed in unicode.

        The ciphertext is stored in "units," which look like: (encoded+character + num_overlaps + " ") num_overlaps
            represents the number of unicode values that, when pow(value, key_unicode_val, alphabet_size), give the same
            result as when pow(plaintext_unicode_val, key_unicode_val, alphabet_size) is calculated. Storing this is
            necessary for decryption in order to figure out which character was the original plaintext since there are
            overlaps.

        Note: Decryption assumes that the plaintext uses only ascii characters(for performance)

        Note: Only use characters in the extended_ascii set for the plaintext

        Note*: Unicode has certain characters called surrogates. These are unprintable. As a result, I had to adjust my
            numbers so that any values that would match surrogates are pushed into the corresponding character. This
            corresponding character is as far away from the end of the surrogates as the "before" value is from the
            start of the surrogates


    VIGENERE_MULTIPLICATIVE.PY
        This vigenere multiplies the character values instead of add. I added this to access
            more of the characters in unicode.* For ascii, and extended_ascii, the characters are displayed as numbers
            instead of in real characters, due to limitations.

        Note: Stored ciphertext in same sort of format in VIGENERE_EXPONENTIAL

        Note: See note on unicode in VIGENERE_EXPONENTIAL










DECRYPTION

    GENERAL FILE FORMAT
        def execute() - this function makes a call to misc's function to encrypt/decrypt in the section:
        USER INTERFACING AND FUNCTION CALLS. misc's function asks for user input if necessary and and writes
        down relevant information to a file. It also returns the decrypted text for this function(execute) to return
        back to cryptography_runner.py. This function is called from cryptography_runner.py

        def testing_execute() - this function is called from test.py. It is the testing form of execute, which means
        that file are not generated in Files_Encrypted or Files_Decrypted. Instead, it writes statistics and
        plain and ciphertext to a file in Files_Logs. This function either calls a general one from misc, or it
        writes specialized statistics itself directly from this function.

        def decrypt() - this function contains the actual algorithm to decrypt the ciphertext. It is generally called
        from misc' encrypt/decrypt function. When in testing mode, however, it is called from testing_execute()
