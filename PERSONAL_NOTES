NEED TO FINISH/FIX:
    Add option to select default char_encoding_scheme/alphabet
    Make block cipher modes of encryption an option instead of extra modules (blowfish_cbc turned to option)
    add clear -a option
    blowfish cbc
    database command
    Whatever was caught by automatic tests
    Update README
    decrypt vigenere_nokey
    for file paths with spaces, add option to enclose in quotation marks (using escape character right now)
    rsa not working on longer texts (Clarissa.txt ...)
    Add type hints to everything




NEED TO ADD:
    add cbc for block ciphers
    graph results for test -a
    Handle failed decryption (because user entered wrong key) for ciphers such as rsa or blowfish that can severely fail





TRY:
    Stuff with C for optimization
